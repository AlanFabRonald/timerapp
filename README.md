## Features

### 1. Core Features
#### 1.1 Add Timer
- A screen to create new timers with the following fields:
  - **Name**: The name of the timer (e.g., "Workout Timer").
  - **Duration**: Timer duration in seconds.
  - **Category**: Assign a category to the timer (e.g., "Workout," "Study," "Break").
- Save the timer to a list and persist the data locally using AsyncStorage.

#### 1.2 Timer List with Grouping
- Display all timers grouped by their categories in expandable/collapsible sections.
- For each timer, show:
  - Name
  - Remaining time
  - Status: Running, Paused, or Completed
- Users can expand or collapse categories to view timers within them.

#### 1.3 Timer Management
- Controls for each timer to:
  - **Start**: Begin countdown
  - **Pause**: Pause countdown
  - **Reset**: Reset to original duration
- Mark timers as "Completed" when they reach zero.

#### 1.4 Progress Visualization
- Show a simple progress bar or percentage for each timer to visualize remaining time relative to the total duration.

#### 1.5 Bulk Actions
- Buttons at the category level to:
  - Start all timers in a category.
  - Pause all timers in a category.
  - Reset all timers in a category.

#### 1.6 User Feedback
- When a timer completes:
  - Show an on-screen modal with a congratulatory message and the timerâ€™s name.

### 2. Enhanced Functionality
#### 2.1 Timer History
- Maintain a log of completed timers with:
  - Timer name
  - Completion time
- Display the log on a separate "History" screen.

#### 2.2 Customizable Alerts
- Allow users to set an optional halfway alert for each timer (e.g., at 50% of the total duration).
- Display a notification or message when the alert triggers.

  - **Home Screen**: Timer list and grouping functionality.
  - **History Screen**: Log of completed timers.
- **Persistence**: Use AsyncStorage for storing timers and logs.
- **Styling**: Use `StyleSheet` for clean and responsive layouts.
- **Timers**: Implement time management logic using `setInterval`.

### Bonus Features
1. **Export Timer Data**: Allow users to export timer history as a JSON file.
2. **Custom Themes**: Support for light and dark modes with a theme switcher.
3. **Category Filtering**: Add a filter dropdown to show timers from specific categories only.
